<h2>About Cowbell</h2>
Cowbell is a project to make it easier for everyone to make some noise when they find interesting Ansible content on the interwebs.
<p>
This respository primarily serves as support for the <a href="https://github.com/robynbergeron/cowbell/wiki">Cowbell wiki</a>.
<p>
<h2>What Cowbell Does</h2>
Cowbell is a place where you can submit:
<ul>
<li>New content you have seen, like a blog post, news article, video, slide deck, or some other cool thing.
<li>Details about upcoming events where Ansible will be discussed, such as conferences, meetups, hackathons, user group meetings, webcasts, or anything that is live-and-in-person (or live-over-the-internet).
<li>New Cool code things, like open source projects using Ansible, playbooks, new awesome Galaxy roles, or new modules in Ansible, including new modules that need review love, or modules that need new owners.
</ul>
<p>
Cowbell takes all of the Magical Ansible Content and gets it organized by date and type. (Let there be no illusions; this is not some sort of process automated by unicorns. This is handcrafted, special snowflake typing magic, for the moment.) The most recent submissions, events, news, etc. are presented on a "Current Week's Stuff" type page; older things are archived.
<p>
<h2>Why do I want to ring the Cowbell?</h2>
Lots of things, potentially. But basically: When you ring the cowbell, other people can ring their cowbells! (This results in, as you might expect, <b>mooo-re cowbell</b>. And when people feel awesome for having their work promoted, they might do even more! And then <b>EVEN MOO-RE COWBELL!</b>)
<p>
<ul>
<li>Your Ansible community pals can promote your event on Twitter, Facebook, their megaphone, or even MySpace, but I'm not sure the last one still exists.
<li>If you're giving a talk or presentation, you could get stickers and other swag to give to your lovely attendees! Details on how this works out via the wiki is still TBD, of course :)
<li>There is probably a newsletter in our future! Things that come here, can potentially go into that amazing future piece of regular literature.
<li>The best of the best things about Ansible? They could totally make their way into <a href="https://github.com/jdauphant/awesome-ansible">the Awesome Ansible page</a>, if amazing contributors make that happen.
</ul>
<h2>Cowbell Process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cowbell entries can be directly entered onto the wiki. Simple asks:
<ul>
<li>Please follow the formatting examples on the wiki page.
<li>Be willing to follow up / make edits if someone asks for clarification.
<li>If your information is an event, it is particularly helpful if, in the situation where an event is cancelled, to cross out the event (using a strikethrough) and state that it is cancelled, so that anyone promoting the event can stop doing so. 
</ul>
<li>If you're unfamiliar with wiki editing, please file an issue using <a href="https://github.com/robynbergeron/cowbell/issues/new?title=Add%20a%20%5Bblog%20post,%20news%20article,%20slide%20deck,%20video%20link%5D%20(Choose%20one!)&body=Thanks%20for%20letting%20us%20know%20about%20the%20Ansible%20content%20you%27ve%20found.%0A%0AWhile%20we%20are%20happy%20to%20accept%20edits%20to%20our%20wiki,%20we%20know%20not%20everyone%20is%20familiar%20with%20how%20to%20do%20that.%20That%27s%20why%20we%20have%20this%20handy%20form!%20(If%20you%20want%20to%20submit%20a%20PR,%20follow%20the%20%22guidelines%20for%20contributing%22%20link%20above%20for%20information%20on%20how!)%0A%0APlease%20fill%20out%20the%20following%20template%20to%20make%20it%20easier%20for%20us%20to%20include%20your%20information.%0A%0A-%20Type:%20Blog,%20news%20article,%20slide%20deck,%20video%20(Choose%20one)%0A-%20Link:%20paste%20link%20here%0A-%20Description/title:%20Give%20a%20description.%0A-%20Date%20created:%20Date%20content%20was%20created.">this link</a>, which is pre-populated with a template to make it easy for a contributor to add your information to the wiki. Please take a moment to see if your link has already been added to Cowbell and save yourself a bit of time! :)
<li>Links submitted via the filing of an issue will be processed at least once on a weekly basis, if not more often. 
<li>If the link you are adding to Cowbell was submitted as an issue in Github, please leave a comment in the issue indicating this, so it can be closed.
</ul>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Can I hold the cowbell? Polish the cowbell? I want to do things.</b> Sure! Take a look at CONTRIBUTING.md. (You'll have to wait until I write it, though. Just assume until then that you can totally do things. Just start doing them!)
<li><b>I want to be the cow. Can I be the cow?</b> Sorry, enthusiastic, cow-aspiring friends. That role is currently fulfilled by <a href="http://twitter.com/Ansibull">Ansibull</a>. Who is, technically, a bull, of course, and not a cow, but he is the proud bearer of the Bell.
<li><b>So who is the cowboy (or cowgirl) who wrangles all of this?</b> That's me! Robyn. I work at Ansible on community things. But with all the bell-ringing going on, mooo-re wranglers are always helpful! Just dig in. No cowpies here. Promise.
</ul>
<h2>Cowbell Origins</h2>
Cowbell was created by @robynbergeron to more publicly share the information she was already collecting for herself about Ansible-things-to-be-promoted. And because, despite the magic of the Interwebs, she would still miss things that others are probably finding. Finally: moved it out of her personal repository into the Ansible/ambassadors space so that the work could be more easily found, and to generally follow the golden rules of open source around transparency and openness. Kumbaya, my friends!
<h2>Notes for after moving:</h2>
AFTER MOVING TO Ansible/community repo:
* This file should probably be renamed to COWBELL.md.
* Links need to be fixed to integrate 
* And add some info to CONTRIBUTING.md in the community repo as well. Or make this be a separate folder in that repo?
