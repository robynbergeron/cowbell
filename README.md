<h2>About Cowbell</h2>
Cowbell is a project to make it easier for everyone to make some noise when they find interesting Ansible content on the interwebs.
<p>
This respository primarily serves as support for the <a href="https://github.com/robynbergeron/cowbell/wiki">Cowbell wiki</a>.
<p>
<h2>What Cowbell Does</h2>
Cowbell is a place where you can submit:
<ul>
<li>New content you have seen, like a blog post, news article, video, slide deck, or some other cool thing.
<li>Details about upcoming events where Ansible will be discussed, such as conferences, meetups, hackathons, user group meetings, webcasts, or anything that is live-and-in-person (or live-over-the-internet).
<li>Cool code things, like open source projects using Ansible, playbooks, new awesome Galaxy roles, or new modules in Ansible.
</ul>
<p>
Cowbell takes all of the Magical Ansible Content and gets it organized by date and type. (Let there be no illusions; this is not some sort of process automated by unicorns. This is handcrafted, special snowflake typing magic, for the moment.) The most recent submissions, events, news, etc. are presented on a "Current Week's Stuff" type page; older things are archived.
<p>
<h2>Why do I want to ring the Cowbell?</h2>
Lots of things, potentially. But basically: When you ring the cowbell, other people can ring their cowbells! (This results in, as you might expect, <b>mooo-re cowbell</b>.)
<p>
<ul>
<li>Your Ansible community pals can promote your event on Twitter, Facebook, their megaphone, or even MySpace, but I'm not sure the last one still exists.
<li>If you're giving a talk or presentation, you could get stickers and other swag to give to your lovely attendees! Details on how this works out via the wiki is still TBD, of course :)
<li>There is probably a newsletter in our future! Things that come here, can potentially go into that amazing future piece of regular literature.
<li>The best of the best things about Ansible? They could totally make their way into <a href="https://github.com/jdauphant/awesome-ansible">the Awesome Ansible page</a>, if amazing contributors make that happen.
</ul>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Can I hold the cowbell? Polish the cowbell? I want to do things.</b> Sure! Take a look at CONTRIBUTING.md. (You'll have to wait until I write it, though. Just assume until then that you can totally do things. Just start doing them!)
<li><b>I want to be the cow. Can I be the cow?</b> Sorry, enthusiastic, cow-aspiring friends. That role is currently fulfilled by <a href="http://twitter.com/Ansibull">Ansibull</a>. Who is, technically, a bull, of course, and not a cow, but he is the proud bearer of the Bell.
<li><b>So who is the cowboy (or cowgirl) who wrangles all of this?</b> That's me! Robyn. I work at Ansible on community things. But with all the bell-ringing going on, mooo-re wranglers are always helpful! Just dig in. No cowpies here. Promise.
